IF YOU ARE CHANGING OPENIAB (the submodule)
- make you changes in the submodule
- change to the ./OpenIAB folder
- build OpenIAB with ./gradlew buildNeeded

THIS WILL THEN COMPILE YOUR SOURCE - the results are hidden in a sample folder but
this doesn't matter cause you're NOW going to have to change the gradle build of
the OpenIAB-Unity-Plugin project. If you dont do this then it will just pull the
OpenIAB jar file from the internet and ignore your work :(

- change ./unity_plugin/build.gradle
Make dependencies look like:

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar')
    //compile "org.onepf:openiab:$openIabVersion"
    compile fileTree(dir: '../OpenIAB/samples/trivialdrive/build/intermediates/exploded-aar/OpenIAB/OpenIab Library/unspecified/libs', include: '*.jar')
    compile fileTree(dir: '../OpenIAB/samples/trivialdrive/build/intermediates/exploded-aar/OpenIAB/OpenIab Library/unspecified/', include: '*.jar')
}

This will build it with your version (its in 2 jars - NO IDEA WHY)
You also need to change another section:

def openIabJar = project.configurations.compile.find {
    it.name.startsWith "openiab-${openIabVersion}"
}

//assert openIabJar != null
ant.unzip(src: '/Users/ben/Code/OpenIAB-Unity-Plugin/OpenIAB/samples/trivialdrive/build/intermediates/exploded-aar/OpenIAB/OpenIab Library/unspecified/classes.jar', dest: outAbsoluteDir)
ant.unzip(src: '/Users/ben/Code/OpenIAB-Unity-Plugin/OpenIAB/samples/trivialdrive/build/intermediates/exploded-aar/OpenIAB/OpenIab Library/unspecified/libs/in-app-purchasing-1.0.3.jar', dest: outAbsoluteDir)
//ant.unzip(src: openIabJar.absolutePath, dest: outAbsoluteDir)

//    Copy compiled unity-plugin java source
copy {
    from "${project(':Unity Plugin').projectDir.absolutePath}" +
            "${sep}build${sep}intermediates${sep}classes${sep}release"
    into outAbsoluteDir
    include '**/*.class'
}

This will copy the contents of what you've built into the resulting magical OpenIAB-plugin.jar

NOW BUILD THE PLUGIN
- ./gradlew buildPlugin

The OpenIAB-plugin.jar will now exist in ./unity_plugin/unity_src/Assets/Plugins/Android/OpenIAB-plugin.jar - PUT THIS IN YOUR PROJECT.

KTHANKSBYE.
